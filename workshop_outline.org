[] `C-x C-c` to close emacs
[] Talk about Keychords
Everything in Emacs can (and should be done) by keyboard. No mouse here. Emacs uses key combinations to do call everything.
And when I say everything I mean everything. Even pressing the letter a is a keybinding to a command that will write a on 
the current buffer.
[] How to find the help. `C-h`
[] `C-g` to escape from everything or Esc-Esc-Esc

[] `C-x o` for movement between buffers
[] `C-x 0` close this buffer
[] `C-x 1` Close all buffers but this
[] `C-number` plus keychord repeats the command x amount of times
[] `C-h b` all current keybindings. 
[] `C-s` and `C-r` search 
[] Show `M-x`
[] M-x describe-package
[] M-x describe-mode
