# EMACS Workshop

## Intro

This workshop is an introduction to Emacs for its use as a development tool. We will be looking briefly at how to operate on it. 
For the workshop we will be using a virtual machine with an Emacs already installed on it.

## Requirements:

Laptop. VirtualBox installed on the laptop. Downloaded VM.
